1.1.0 - Added support for SQLite
      - Added support for retrieving migrations from multiple assemblies (thanks to FlorianHoornaar)
      - Int64 can be used as data type in primary keys
	  - Restricted usage of .AsIdentity() to Int32 and Int64 data typed columns
	  - Removed .AsIdentity() option when adding columns (was not implemented consistently and was missing integration testing and constitues a super special-case which is hard to implement consistently for all platforms)
      - IProvider: added the DropDefault method which replaces the AddedColumn.DropThereafter and gives the providers
	    more flexibility to report what they support and what not
      - Teradata: raise validation error on adding/dropping primary keys (Teradata does not support that)
1.0.1 - BUG FIXES:
	    - Oracle: multiple Mig# instances can be maintained side-by-side on the same database
		- SQL Tracing: do not throw if the emitted SQL contains curly brackets
1.0.0 - Initial release

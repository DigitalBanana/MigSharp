1.1.0 - Added support for SQLite (without foreign keys)
      - Added support for retrieving migrations from multiple assemblies (thanks to FlorianHoornaar)
      - Extended/completed list of allowed primary key data types for all providers
	  - Restricted usage of .AsIdentity() to Int32 and Int64 data typed columns
	  - Removed .AsIdentity() option when adding columns (was not implemented consistently and was missing integration testing and constitues a super special-case which is hard to implement consistently for all platforms)
      - IProvider: added the DropDefault method which replaces the AddedColumn.DropThereafter and gives the providers
	    more flexibility to report what they support and what not
      - Teradata:
	    - raise validation error on adding/dropping primary keys (Teradata does not support that)
	  - BUG FIXES:
	    - SQL Server 2005/2008: rename default constraint along with the column (fixes the case when adding a new column with a default value which has the same name of a previously renamed column with a default value)
		- Teradata: removed MINVALUE and MAXVALUE for identity columns which is not needed and caused unexpected errors
1.0.1 - BUG FIXES:
	    - Oracle: multiple Mig# instances can be maintained side-by-side on the same database
		- SQL Tracing: do not throw if the emitted SQL contains curly brackets
1.0.0 - Initial release

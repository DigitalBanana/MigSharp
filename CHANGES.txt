1.0.2 - BUG FIXES:
	    - SQL Server 2005/2008:
		  - rename default constraint along with the column (fixes the case when adding a new column with a default value which has the same name of a previously renamed column with a default value)
		- Oracle:
		  - rename identity sequence and trigger along with the table
		- Teradata:
		  - escape new name when renaming a table
		  - removed MINVALUE and MAXVALUE for identity columns which is not needed and caused unexpected errors
1.0.1 - BUG FIXES:
	    - Oracle: multiple Mig# instances can be maintained side-by-side on the same database
		- SQL Tracing: do not throw if the emitted SQL contains curly brackets
1.0.0 - Initial release

This file contains global TODOs for the next release that are not in the source code
====================================================================================

- SQLite
	- is it okay to implment UNIQUE as constraints?
	- is it okay not to implement FKs?
	- DbType.Single throws a System.OverflowException in the SQLiteDataReader when trying to convert the data type to a decimal!?
	- update wiki and all referencing pages to include SQLite support
- Document custom bootstrapping and custom versioning
- Document TemporaryDefault feature
- fix all FIXME and NotImplementedException

Nice-to-have/backlog:
- find out *all* data types that are supported for keys
- publish with NuGet?
- see Roadmap in GitHub Wiki

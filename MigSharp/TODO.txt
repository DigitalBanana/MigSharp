This file contains global TODOs for the next release that are not in the source code
====================================================================================

- provide means to replace legacy versioning table by asking once at beginning which version is the current one
  --> DbVersion table gets populated by these entries
- execute down steps before executing a newly added historic step?
  --> adding historic steps is dangerous! do not support this scenario?
- use long instead of DateTime parts
- xml-document fluent interface
- add LICENSE
- exhaustively test whole fluent interface (100% code coverage)
- include logo
